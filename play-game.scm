To play:
   1. Update file paths in this file and game-commands.
   2. Load this file.
   3. In the REPL, start game with (start-game).

TODO: make the game actually end with win/lose?
TODO: make the non-numerical cards have value?
TODO: for some reason, you can pick mutliple cards right now... Umpire not enforcing?
